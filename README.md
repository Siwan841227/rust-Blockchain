# rust-Blockchain
Create a Rust-based token wallet for the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) blockchain. This wallet should support basic functionalities such as sending and receiving IRCRC2 tokens, and it should demonstrate your proficiency with Rust and blockchain principles.
To develop smart contracts in Rust for managing token transactions on the DFINITY Internet Computer (ICP) test network, follow these steps:

 Set Up Development Environment
First, ensure you have the necessary tools installed:

Rust: Ensure Rust is installed on your machine. You can install Rust using rustup by following instructions from rust-lang.org.

DFINITY SDK: Install the DFINITY SDK, which includes the dfx command-line tool for managing local and network deployments. Instructions can be found on the SDK repository.

. Project Initialization
Create a new Rust project for your token smart contract:
